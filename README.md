# GUIDANCE-SDK-ROS-UART 

This is a DJI Guidance ROS node for UART connection, based on the DJI [uart_example](https://github.com/dji-sdk/GuidanceSDK/tree/master/examples/uart_example) from  [GuidanceSDK](https://github.com/dji-sdk/Guidance-SDK) repo.

For USB connection, the repo can be found on [Guidance-SDK-ROS](https://github.com/dji-sdk/Guidance-SDK-ROS).

# How to use
1. Clone the repo to the catkin workspace source directory `catkin_ws/src` and then 

```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone this
cd .. && catkin_make
```
2. Execution with $roslaunch, by specifying your UART connection port.

For example,

```
roslaunch guidance_uart uart_port.launch port:= "/dev/ttyTHS2" 
```
or by rosrunning the node, with the default UART port, on "/dev/ttyTHS2" (UART3),
```
rosrun guidance_uart guidanceNodeUART
```
